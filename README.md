# closelid
An easy macOS script application that allows you to close your macbook lid without the screen turning off. This can be useful for plugging in external monitors and wanting your lid to be closed whilst using it.

This application is very simple.
You open the app, you can choose from 2 options, either 'Disable Sleep' or 'Enable Sleep'.

Disable Sleep disables the macbook from going into sleep mode, and prevents the display from turning off.

Enable Sleep makes it so your macbook goes into sleep mode, and the display turns off when you close the lid.

# How do I use it?
1.  Download the release file.
2.  Open it on your macbook and enjoy :)
